# Formatting `.pmc` — `pmt fmt`

`pmt fmt` reprints a `.pmc` file to one canonical layout — indentation,
label/command alignment, comma-group line breaks, blank lines, and
comment position. It is the fix side of `pmt lint`'s `line-too-long`
finding (`docs/lint.md`): a line that only needs rewrapping, fmt rewraps
it. fmt changes whitespace and comment placement only — it never touches
a token. Leading zeros on a label stay leading zeros, `@goToEnd` stays
`@goToEnd`; renaming, reordering `use` paths, and rewriting numbers are
lint's or the author's job, not fmt's.

## Indentation

4 spaces per block level, never tabs. A `namespace ns { … }` block's
contents sit one level deeper than the namespace header; a function
body sits one level deeper than its header, and a nested function body
one level deeper again. Input tabs and CR line endings are normalized
away by the full reprint: output is always LF, with exactly one final
newline.

## Label and command alignment

Within one function body, every command lines up in a shared **command
column**, and labels right-align into the space before it. The column is
the smallest multiple of 4 that is at least as wide as both the body's
own indent and the widest **inline** label (a label on the same line as
its command) plus 2 — the `+2` reserves a left margin of at least one
space before the label and the one space after its final `:`. An
unlabeled statement indents straight to the command column; a labeled
one right-aligns its `:` so every inline label in the body shares one
colon column, with the command sitting exactly one space after it.

This is the model behind the standard library's own layout — a
two-function excerpt (top-level, inside `namespace std { }`, so the
command column is 8):

```c
namespace std {
    export goToEnd() {
     1: right;
        check(1, 3);
     3: left;
    }

    export goToBegin() {
     1: left;
        check(1, 3);
     3: right;
    }
}
```

A label may also sit on its own line — the author writes a newline
right after its final `:`, and fmt preserves that choice; fmt never
breaks a label itself, only ever moves whitespace around one. An
own-line label that would still fit the label field (its colon lands at
or before the shared colon column) right-aligns like an inline label,
with its command on the following line; one too wide for the field
hangs at a single leading space instead. Neither shape counts toward the
widest-inline-label measurement above. Worked example (command column 8,
set by the five-digit inline label):

```c
foo() {
 11111: right;
    12:
        left;
 999999999:
        halt;
}
```

`12:` is short enough to fit the field and aligns under `11111:`;
`999999999:` overflows it and hangs at one space. Both commands land on
the command column regardless.

## Comma groups

A statement's comma group (`cmd, cmd, cmd;`) keeps the author's own line
breaks and only reflows when a line doesn't fit:

- No newline in the source, and the line fits in 80 characters: one
  line, each `,` tight to the preceding command with one space after.
- No newline in the source, but it overflows 80: greedy-fill — pack
  commands onto the line while they still fit, break after the last
  comma that fit, and continue the remainder on a new line indented to
  the command column, repeating as needed.
- The author already split the group across lines: that grouping is
  preserved verbatim, continuation lines indented to the command column;
  greedy-fill only kicks in on an individual preserved line that itself
  exceeds 80.

```c
foo() {
 1: left, right, mark;
}
```

versus an author-preserved split:

```c
foo() {
 1: left, right,
    mark;
}
```

A statement with no comma to break on — a single long command, most
often a long qualified call — cannot be wrapped and stays over 80
characters; `line-too-long` still reports it.

## Blank lines

The author's blank lines are preserved, runs of two or more collapsed
to one, none forced. fmt never inserts a blank line — not between
declarations, not between statements, not between adjacent `use` lines,
not around a standalone comment. There are exactly two places fmt
removes blank lines the author wrote, both edits to existing blanks,
never a fresh insertion elsewhere: a run of two or more consecutive
blank lines collapses to one, anywhere; and a blank line sitting
immediately after a body's opening `{` or immediately before its
closing `}` is stripped entirely (to zero, not one), so a blank right at
a body's edge never survives even as a single line. Everywhere else, a
single blank the author left stays exactly as written, and its absence
is never filled in. There is deliberately no "one blank line between
declarations" rule to enforce.

## Comments

Every comment keeps its position relative to the code around it: a
comment on its own line before a declaration or statement stays there
(and travels with it — a blank line the author placed above the comment
stays above the comment, not between the comment and what it documents);
a comment dangling before a body's closing brace prints at the body's
indent; block-comment interiors are reprinted verbatim, untouched.

A trailing comment (same line as the statement it follows) gets one
space before its `//` by default. When the author aligned a run of two
or more trailing comments in a column, fmt keeps them aligned — the
column is recomputed from the reformatted code (the longest line in the
run, plus one space), so the alignment survives even though the code
around it reflowed. If keeping a comment aligned would push its line
past 80 characters, that one line falls back to a single space instead
(and may then be reported by `line-too-long`); the rest of the run stays
aligned.

## Doc and attention runs

A `?`/`!` run (`docs/language.md`, doc lines and attention lines) prints
directly above the function declaration it binds to, at that
declaration's own indent — column 0 for a top-level function, body
indent for a nested one, the same indent the header line itself prints
at. Each run line is sigil, then exactly one canonical space, then its
text verbatim; an empty line collapses to the bare sigil with no
trailing space, the paragraph-break notation for a run of `?` lines. The
canonical space is the only thing normalized — the text itself is a
token like any other and is never touched, so a `[deprecated]`
attribute's `! [deprecated] message` shape carries straight through with
no special-casing. There is no wrapping: a run line over 80 characters
stays as written and is `line-too-long`'s business (`docs/lint.md`), not
fmt's — the same split this page draws for any single unbreakable
command.

```c
? Moves the head one cell to the right.
?
? Then checks whether it landed on a mark.
! [deprecated] use goToMark instead
step() {
    right;
    check(1, !);
}
```

An ordinary comment interleaved inside a run prints under the Comments
rule above, at the run's own indent. Blank lines inside a run follow the
same collapse-to-one policy as everywhere else. The gap before the whole
run (between a prior declaration and this one's run) and the gap between
the run's last line and the declaration it binds to are two independent
blanks, each the author's own to keep or omit — fmt neither forces nor
removes either beyond the standard collapse.

## Spacing

Canonical intra-statement spacing, independent of what the source wrote:

| Construct | Canonical |
|---|---|
| Call | `@name(...)` — `@` tight to the name, name tight to `(` |
| Builtin + successor | `left(5)`, `mark(!)` — no space before `(`, contents tight |
| `check` | `check(1, 3)` — tight `(`, one space after the arm comma, tight `)` |
| `goto` | `goto 5` — one space |
| Path | `std::x` — `::` tight |
| `,` / `;` | tight to the preceding token; one space after `,`, newline after `;` |
| `as` | one space each side: `their::name as alias` |
| `!` | tight — `(!)`, `check(!, 1)` |

A spaced form the grammar still accepts (`1 : right;`, `std :: goToEnd`)
is normalized to the tight form above; fmt never strips a token, so a
mandatory pair of call parens (`@f();`) is left exactly as written.

## `--check`, stdin, and exit codes

```
pmt fmt PATH... [--exclude PATH]... [--check]
pmt fmt -       [--check] [--lang pmc|pma]
```

By default `pmt fmt` rewrites each file in place, and only when its
formatted text differs from what's on disk — an already-formatted file
is never rewritten, so running fmt does not churn file modification
times across a clean tree. `--check` writes nothing: it lists the path
of every file whose formatted text would differ, and exits 1 if any
did (0 if none did) — the CI-friendly mode. `-` reads one source from
stdin — `.pmc` by default, or `.pma` under `--lang pma` (`docs/cli.md`)
— and writes the formatted text to stdout, for editors without an LSP
hooked up and for shell pipelines or git filters; `-` cannot be
combined with `PATH` arguments. `- --check` mirrors the same semantics
against stdin: nothing is written either way, and the exit code alone
says whether the input would change.

Exit codes: 0 = success — every file (or stdin) is already canonical, or
was rewritten in place; 1 = under `--check`, at least one input would
change, or a lex/parse error occurred anywhere in the batch. A file that
fails to lex or parse is reported and left untouched; with a directory
walk, the rest of the batch still runs.
