# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

A Rust toolchain for a Post machine: C-like `.pmc` language → optimizing compiler → assembler → linker → bus-accurate VM, all driven by one CLI (`pmt`). GPL-3.0-or-later. It completes work spread across four Delphi implementations (2002–2012); `docs/history.md` has the lineage. A future Turing toolchain (`tmt`, arch TM-1) is expected to reuse the arch-agnostic core — `docs/examples/brainfuck-utm.tma` is a speculative TM-1 assembly file validating that design, not runnable code.

**Current state: v0.2.0 released 2026-07-12** (crates 0.2.0, `.pmc` language 0.3 with doc/attention lines + LSP hover, PM-1 `.pma` dialect 0.2, full `.pma` lint/fmt/LSP parity, both editor plugins at 0.1.2 attached to the GH release; ~1,050 tests). Roadmap (triaged on closed issue #2): next design round = #16 project manifest (+#11 `pmt build`), then #5 DAP; big arcs #8 tmt → #6 wasm → #7 async bus; small open: #22, #24; upstream watch: redhat-developer/lsp4ij#1612 (Cmd+hover underline).

## Commands

```
cargo build --release                                   # produces target/release/pmt
cargo test --workspace                                  # everything: unit + integration + property tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings   # quality gate
cargo fmt --check                                       # quality gate
```

Single test file / single test:

```
cargo test -p mtc-post-machine --test cli_programs
cargo test -p mtc-post-machine --test opt_equivalence <test_name>
```

Regenerate golden files (explicit, `#[ignore]`d — writes into `crates/post-machine/tests/golden/`):

```
cargo test -p mtc-post-machine --test golden_programs regen -- --ignored
```

`pmt` exit codes from `run`: 0 = program stopped (`stp`), 2 = halted (`hlt`), 3 = trapped. Full flag reference: `docs/cli.md`.

Editor plugin builds live only under `editors/` (never repo root): `cd editors/vscode && npm run package` (vsix); `cd editors/jetbrains && JAVA_HOME=<a JetBrains IDE's bundled JBR> ./gradlew buildPlugin` (zip) — each README has specifics.

## Documentation authority

`README.md` + `CHANGELOG.md` + `docs/` (language, isa, formats, cli, lint, fmt, stdlib, history, lsp) are the durable references. The original design spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-post-machine-toolchain-design.md` is **FROZEN** — a historical record, no longer amended and no longer cited by code. Code comments cite the durable pages by page + parenthetical topic keyword, e.g. `docs/isa.md (timing model)`. **No `docs/superpowers/` spec or plan is ever cited by code — frozen or active.** A task brief may quote a driving spec as `spec §N`; that notation is internal and MUST NOT survive into a doc comment. When the durable `docs/` page for a feature doesn't exist yet, carry the substance in prose (a `spec §N` ref is not a placeholder for it) and add the `docs/<page>.md (keyword)` citation once the page lands. Published content (README, `docs/`, code comments) is forge-agnostic: no issue/PR numbers, no hosting-provider URLs — describe substance in prose. Internal artifacts (`docs/superpowers/`, this file) are unrestricted.

## Architecture

Two-crate workspace with a hard boundary:

- **`crates/core` (`mtc-core`)** — arch-agnostic by contract: container formats (MO/MX/MT), the sans-I/O VM core + bus + driver + tape devices + `DebugSession`, the linker, the assembler/disassembler frameworks (since the parity round: a total lossless assembly CST — `asm/{lexer,cst,lower}.rs`, spanned coded `AsmError` — plus arch-agnostic asm lint (`asm/lint/`, 5 rules driven by `Flow`/`break_opcode`) and the canonical-grid formatter `asm/fmt.rs`), and the language-agnostic LSP server framework (`core/src/lsp/`: transport, JSON-RPC, protocol types, position mapping, document store, multi-service server loop behind the `LanguageService` trait with per-URI language routing and capability merging — fake-service tested, zero PM-1/.pmc knowledge). It carries **zero PM-1 knowledge**; its own tests run against a crate-private fake arch (`vm/arch.rs::test_arch`, arch id `0x7F`) to prove it.
- **`crates/post-machine` (`mtc-post-machine`)** — everything PM-1: the arch module, the `.pmc` compiler pipeline, the optimizer, the embedded stdlib, the `.pmc` lint/fmt layers, both `LanguageService` implementations (`lsp/` pmc + `lsp/pma/`), and the `pmt` binary.

Dependencies are deliberately minimal: `serde`/`serde_json` only, `proptest` as a dev-dep. **No clap** — CLI arg parsing is hand-rolled.

### Pipeline and key types

`.pmc` → `lexer.rs` (`Vec<Token>`; grammar 0.3 incl. positional `?`/`!` doc-line tokens) → `parser.rs` (recursive descent; `parse` = `lower_cst ∘ parse_cst` over one lossless CST shared with fmt/LSP) → `compiler.rs::compile(source, CompileOptions) -> CompileOutput` which internally runs duplicate-binding checks → flatten (name mangling + visibility; also builds `Analysis.docs`, the qualified doc/deprecation map consumed by the `deprecated-call` lint, hover, and completion tags) → `ir::lower` (`IrProgram`, a versioned per-function CFG) → `optimizer::optimize` (in-place) → `codegen::emit_program` (CFG → `.pma` text only) → core `asm::assemble` (`ObjectFile`). The IR is a **documented, versioned JSON artifact** (`IR_VERSION` in `ir.rs`), not an internal detail.

Then: core `linker::link(objects, libraries, LinkOptions) -> LinkOutput { executable, map, report }` → `vm::Machine::from_executable` → `run` / `DebugSession`.

### The arch contract

An architecture plugs into core through two tables, both living in the arch crate:

1. `Arch` trait (`core/src/vm/arch.rs`) — `operand_kind(opcode)` + `lower(opcode, operand) -> Vec<MicroOp>`: the VM core executes micro-ops and **knows no opcodes**.
2. `ArchSyntax` (`core/src/asm/mod.rs`) — mnemonic/relaxation tables for the assembler/disassembler, plus `break_opcode` (drives the arch-agnostic `leftover-debugger` lint). PM-1's is `pm1_syntax()` in `post-machine/src/asm/mod.rs`; short opcode = far `| 0x10`.

### VM model

`Core` (`vm/core.rs`) is a pure `BusResponse -> BusRequest` transition function — no I/O, no opcode knowledge. The synchronous `driver.rs` answers bus requests and does all tact accounting: fetch/execute cost **core tacts**; device move/read/write add **stall tacts** scaled by `TactProfile`. Traps are controlled stops (typed `Trap`), distinct from `stp`/`hlt`. Tape devices are index-based (the processor never sees glyphs): `InfiniteTape`, `AnnularTape`, and `StrictTape` (a decorator faulting on writing a cell's existing value — the historic 2006/2007 semantics).

### Optimizer (`post-machine/src/optimizer/`)

Eight passes, fixpoint-looped with a round cap: `inline` (program-level, runs first) then per-function `check_fold`, `jump_threading`, `cell_state`, `branch_fold`, `tail_call`, `tail_merge`, `dce`. Constraints that are contracts, not preferences:

- **Pass order**: `tail_call` must run before `tail_merge` (return-chaining destroys tail-call's precondition). Stated in `optimizer/mod.rs`.
- **MF-coupling soundness** (`optimizer/dataflow.rs`): after ≥1 tape op the match flag equals the cell at head; before any tape op it is the decoupled reset value. The `Uncoupled | Coupled(_)` lattice tracks this; check-edge refinement applies only on provably coupled paths.
- **-O0 bit-identity**: `-O0` output must stay byte-identical to plain codegen — no optimizer artifact may leak.
- **Equivalence contract** (enforced by `tests/opt_equivalence.rs`): passes preserve final tape, termination kind, and MF-dependent branches. Step counts and resource-limit outcomes may change — except across an un-stripped `brk`, which is an observability barrier no motion crosses.

### Formats (`core/src/formats/`)

Pure byte codecs, little-endian, no I/O. `.pmo`/MO (objects), `.pmx`/MX (pure code image — tape supplied at run time), `.pmt`/MT (tape snapshots; **glyphs live only here**). Containers are identified by `sniff()` on the magic — **never dispatch on file extensions**. Every reader verifies CRC-32 before decoding anything. Debug names live in the JSON `.pmx.map` sidecar, keeping `.pmx` a pure image.

### Linker (`core/src/linker/`)

Two-phase: `resolve` (namespace + BFS reachability from `main` — unreachable functions are dropped and may reference anything) then `layout` (relaxation: a monotone shrink-only fixpoint that narrows far calls to short; the assembler always emits far `call` — only the linker selects `call.s`). Libraries are first-wins and silently shadowed by user definitions.

### Stdlib (`post-machine/src/stdlib/`)

An embedded `.pmc` string (`include_str!("std.pmc")`, 11 exported `std::` routines), compiled once per process via `OnceLock` at `-O1` with debugger strips — embedded deliberately because a cargo-installed binary has no data directory. Linked lazily via the reachability pass; `--nostdlib` opts out.

### CLI (`post-machine/src/cli/`)

**Thin-renderer rule: library code never prints.** Every stage returns a structured report (`CompileReport`, `LinkReport`, `OptReport`, `RunResult`); every byte of terminal output originates in `cli/` (rendered under `-v`), and errors flow as typed values. `bin/pmt.rs` is a shell around `cli::execute`. Eleven subcommands split across `build.rs` (compile/asm/link), `inspect.rs` (dis/tape/ir), `run.rs` (run, incl. live `--trace`), `completions.rs` (completions), `lint.rs` (lint — both languages by extension, shared allow namespace), `fmt.rs` (fmt — both languages, stdin via `-` with `--lang`), `lsp.rs` (lsp — the dual-language LSP server on stdio; the only place real stdio is handed to the core server loop).

### Shell completion (`post-machine/src/completions/`)

`pmt completions <shell>` (design doc: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-pmt-shell-completion-design.md`) emits a completion script to stdout. `pmt` is hand-rolled with no clap, so the script can't be generated by a framework and risks drifting from the flags the parser actually accepts. `completions::registry` is the single in-crate description of the CLI surface (9 subcommands including `completions` and `lint`, each with its flags' value shape — boolean / space-or-equals value / `--emit-ir[=STAGE]`'s equals-only-optional value / `--fno-<pass>`'s suffix family — exclusive groups, and a positional's file-extension filter, incl. `lint`'s dirs-and-files positional); `completions::zsh` renders a standard `_arguments -C` nested `#compdef` script from it — a `dirs: true` positional/flag renders as an `_alternative` combining the extension glob with a bare directory completion (design doc §6.1). `crates/post-machine/tests/completions_registry.rs` is the drift guard: it cross-checks the `--fno-<pass>`/`--emit-ir=after:<pass>` choices against `optimizer::pass_names()` exactly, and probes the real parser with every registry entry (`Args::positionals` rejects an unrecognized dashed token with "unknown flag", so a typo or invented registry entry surfaces there) — the one direction it cannot check is a real flag the registry is MISSING, since the hand-rolled parser has no reflection over its match arms. `crates/post-machine/tests/completions_zsh.rs` shells out to a real `zsh` to confirm the rendered script parses (`zsh -n`) and loads under `compinit` without errors (skipped with a note if `zsh` isn't on `PATH`); full interactive candidate correctness needs a pty feeding real keystrokes and was checked manually rather than automated. bash and fish are recognized shell names (`pmt completions bash`/`fish` name themselves in a clear not-yet-implemented error) but don't render yet — the design doc has the exact registry addition `build` (issue #11) will need without registering it as an active entry.

### Editor integration (`post-machine/src/lsp/`, `editors/`)

`crates/post-machine/src/lsp/` holds BOTH `LanguageService`s — `.pmc` (diagnostics, completions with qualified-name detail, go-to-definition, hover with deprecation/attention callouts, quickfixes, semantic tokens, formatting) and `.pma` (`lsp/pma/` — same features minus hover, completion detail = operand hints) — served by one `pmt lsp` process through core's multi-service routing. `pmt.json` is the one project config file (nearest-ancestor discovery, `lint.allow`, union semantics with IDE settings — never a cascade) read by both the CLI and the server; schema in `docs/lint.md`. `editors/` ships single-source TextMate grammars (pmc + pma, drift-guarded against the parser/`pm1_syntax()`) plus a VS Code extension and a JetBrains/LSP4IJ plugin (both 0.1.2, `pmt` floor 0.2.0 via `MIN_TESTED_PMT`), both sideload-only with a manual-checklist README and attached to GH releases; the node/gradle toolchains those need live only under `editors/`, never at the repo root. Known upstream limitation: JetBrains Cmd+hover may underline the whole file (LSP4IJ ignores `originSelectionRange` on TextMate-backed file types; reported upstream).

## Testing conventions

- Integration tests live per crate under `tests/`; there is no shared test-support module — each file defines its own local helpers.
- **Goldens are derivation-first**: `golden_programs.rs` derives the expected `TapeSnapshot` in code, asserts the run matches the derivation, then asserts the committed `.pmt` is byte-identical to the derived snapshot. Never regenerate goldens from run output.
- `opt_equivalence.rs` runs each program at `-O0` and `-O1` on the same tapes and compares observables.
- Core's format round-trips and the operand codec are property-tested (`proptest`), including never-panics-on-noise cases.

## Commit style

Conventional commits with scope: `feat(cli):`, `fix(core):`, `test(post-machine):`, `docs(plan):`, `polish(post-machine):`.

## Version spaces and release notes

The repo carries several independently versioned contracts — the
toolchain crates, the `.pmc` language (`PMC_LANG_VERSION`, an acceptance
contract: pre-1.0 it is `0.N` and N bumps on ANY grammar change;
major/minor axes activate at a declared 1.0; no patch digit — errata and
implementation-conformance fixes never move it), the per-arch `.pma`
dialects (same kind of contract; PM-1's is `PM1_PMA_DIALECT_VERSION`,
born at 0.2 when labels tightened to dot-free), `IR_VERSION` (JSON
encoding), and the container formats (MO/MX/MT). The toolchain version
is never the carrier for a language version.

Release notes open with a **version block** listing ALL of these spaces
explicitly, stating `unchanged` where nothing moved — the block doubles
as a compatibility matrix across releases. Component sections follow
only where changes exist. `CHANGELOG.md` (first entry: v0.2.0) uses this
structure in ref-free prose (published-docs policy); tracker links
belong in GH release notes.

Realized release flow (v0.2.0 precedent): docs audit first (per-page
claim verification + citation-keyword resolution); bump both crates,
both editor plugins, and their `MIN_TESTED_PMT` floors in one commit
with the CHANGELOG entry; merge, tag `vX.Y.Z`, `gh release create` with
the freshly built plugin artifacts attached.
